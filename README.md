# Modern Hacker News userstyle for Stylus

It's not a secret that [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) is a bit... dated at this point. I love reading it, I love the links, but man it brings me back to the 90's. This userstyle aims to restyle the original interface with a more modern one.

Forked from https://github.com/Gigacore/hackernews-userstyles.

## Installation

1. Install the [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) extension for Chrome, Firefox or Opera.
2. Install either theme by clicking either [light](modern-hacker-news-light.user.css) or [dark](modern-hacker-news-dark.user.css) `.user.css` file.
3. Give the style a name, e.g. `Hacker News Readable (Light)` or `Hacker News Readable (Dark)`.
